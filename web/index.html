                                        My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is the
                                        fifth studio album by American rapper
                                        and producer Kanye West. It was released
                                        by Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella
                                        Records on November 22, 2010, following
                                        a period of public controversy for West.
                                        Retreating to a self-imposed exile in
                                        Hawaii after a period of controversy in
                                        2009 following his interruption at the
                                        MTV Music Awards, he recorded the album
                                        at Honolulu's Avex Recording Studio in a
                                        communal environment involving numerous
                                        musicians. Additional recording sessions
                                        took place at Glenwood Place Studios in
                                        Burbank, California, and at the New York
                                        City studios Electric Lady and Platinum
                                        Sound. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy
                                        was mainly produced by West, alongside a
                                        variety of high-profile producers such
                                        as Mike Dean, No I.D., Jeff Bhasker,
                                        RZA, Bink, and DJ Frank E. Critics noted
                                        the music's maximalist aesthetic and
                                        opulent production style that utilizes
                                        various elements from West's previous
                                        work, including soul, pop, baroque,
                                        electro, and symphonic sounds, as well
                                        as progressive rock influences. The
                                        album's lyrics explore themes such as
                                        West's celebrity status, consumer
                                        culture, self-aggrandizement, and the
                                        idealism of the American Dream. Guest
                                        vocalists include Nicki Minaj, Rihanna,
                                        Jay-Z, Pusha T, Rick Ross, Kid Cudi,
                                        John Legend, Bon Iver, and Elton John.
                                        During the album's marketing, West
                                        released free songs through his weekly
                                        GOOD Fridays series, as well as four
                                        singles, including "Power" and "All of
                                        the Lights", with all of them becoming
                                        top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100.
                                        West also released an accompanying
                                        musical short film, Runaway (2010). The
                                        album was an immediate and widespread
                                        critical success and was listed as the
                                        best album of 2010 in many publications'
                                        year-end lists. It was awarded Best Rap
                                        Album at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards,
                                        alongside winning CD of the Year at the
                                        2011 BET Hip Hop Awards. My Beautiful
                                        Dark Twisted Fantasy debuted at number
                                        one on the US Billboard 200, while
                                        reaching the top 10 in five other
                                        countries, including also topping the
                                        Canadian Albums Chart. It eventually
                                        registered a triple platinum
                                        certification in the United States from
                                        the Recording Industry Association of
                                        America (RIAA), alongside sales
                                        certifications in a few other
                                        territories. The album has been played
                                        at least a billion times through the
                                        music streaming service Spotify. Widely
                                        considered West's best album, it is
                                        ranked in several curated lists as the
                                        best album of the 2010s and among the
                                        greatest of all time.
